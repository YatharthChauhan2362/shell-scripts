Use the `echo` command.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

## 5. How can you take user input in a shell script?

Use the `read` command.

     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Files in current directory: file1 file2 file3
     ```

## 14. **Question: What is the purpose of the `case` statement in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** The `case` statement is used for conditional branching based on pattern matching.
     ```bash
     case "$1" in
         start)
             echo "Starting application."
             ;;

             ;;
         *)
             echo "Unknown command."
             ;;
     esac
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     ./myscript.sh start
     Starting application.
     ```

## 15. **Question: How do you use functions in shell scripts?**

     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Line2
     Line5
     ```

## 18. **Question: How do you iterate over files in a directory in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use a `for` loop with the `*` wildcard.
     ```bash
     for file in *; do
         echo "Processing file: $file"
     done
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Processing file: file1
     Processing file: file2
     Processing file: file3
     ```

## 19. **Question: How do you check the exit status of a command in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `$?` variable to check the exit status.
     ```bash
     ls non-existent-file
     if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
         echo "Command succeeded."
     else
         echo "Command failed."
     fi
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Command failed.
     ```

## 20. **Question: What is the purpose of the `trap` command in shell scripting?**

     ```bash
     trap 'echo "Ctrl+C pressed."' SIGINT
     sleep 10
     ```
     **Press Ctrl+C during execution:**
     ```
     Ctrl+C pressed.
     ```


## 21. **Question: How do you check if a directory exists in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `-d` option with the `test` or `[ ]` command to check if a directory exists.
     ```bash
     if [ -d "mydirectory" ]; then
         echo "Directory exists."
     else
         echo "Directory does not exist."
     fi
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Directory exists.
     ```

   **Explanation:** Here, we use the `-d` flag to test whether the specified path points to an existing directory. If it does, the script prints "Directory exists"; otherwise, it prints "Directory does not exist."

## 22. **Question: How do you compare strings in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `=` operator for string equality.
     ```bash
     if [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]; then
         echo "Strings are equal."
     else
         echo "Strings are not equal."
     fi
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Strings are equal.
     ```

   **Explanation:** In shell scripting, the `=` operator is used for string comparison. If the two strings are equal, the script prints "Strings are equal"; otherwise, it prints "Strings are not equal."

## 23. **Question: How do you perform arithmetic operations in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `expr` command or `$(( ))` syntax for arithmetic operations.
     ```bash
     result=$(expr 5 + 3)
     echo "Result: $result"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Result: 8
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `expr` command or `$(( ))` syntax allows you to perform arithmetic operations in a shell script. Here, we add 5 and 3, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.

## 24. **Question: How can you use the `sed` command in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** The `sed` command is used for stream editing. For example, to replace text in a file:
     ```bash
     sed 's/old_text/new_text/' myfile.txt
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Content with new_text.
     Another line with new_text.
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `sed` command performs text substitution in a file. In this example, it replaces occurrences of "old_text" with "new_text" in the specified file (`myfile.txt`).

## 25. **Question: How do you use arrays in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Declare and use arrays with parentheses.
     ```bash
     fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Orange")
     echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     First fruit: Apple
     ```

   **Explanation:** Arrays in shell scripts are declared using parentheses. In this example, we create an array named `fruits` with three elements and print the first element using `${fruits[0]}`.

## 26. **Question: How can you use the `cut` command in shell scripting?**
   - **Answer:** The `cut` command is used to extract sections from each line of a file.
     ```bash
     cut -d',' -f2 myfile.csv
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Yatharth
     Alice
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `cut` command, with the `-d` option specifying the delimiter (`,` in this case) and `-f` option specifying the field number, extracts the second field from each line of the CSV file.

## 27. **Question: How do you check if a command exists in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `command -v` or `type` command.
     ```bash
     if command -v git &> /dev/null; then
         echo "Git is installed."
     else
         echo "Git is not installed."
     fi
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Git is installed.
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `command -v` or `type` command is used to check if a command exists in the system. In this example, we check if `git` is installed.

## 28. **Question: How do you use the `case` statement for pattern matching?**
   - **Answer:** The `case` statement is useful for pattern-based conditional branching.
     ```bash
     case "$day" in
         "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed")
             echo "Weekday."
             ;;
         "Sat" | "Sun")
             echo "Weekend."
             ;;
         *)
             echo "Invalid day."
             ;;
     esac
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Weekend.
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `case` statement allows you to match a variable against multiple patterns. In this example, it checks the value of `$day` and prints whether it's a weekday, weekend, or an invalid day.

## 29. **Question: How do you use the `find` command in shell scripting?**
   - **Answer:** The `find` command is used to search for files and directories.
     ```bash
     find . -type f -name "*.txt"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     ./documents/file1.txt
     ./documents/file2.txt
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `find` command searches for files (`-type f`) with a specific name pattern (`-name "*.txt"`) starting from the current directory (`.`).

## 30. **Question: How do you use the `expr` command for string manipulation?**
   - **Answer:** The `expr` command can be used for string manipulation, such as extracting substrings.
     ```bash
     str="Hello, World!"
     result=$(expr "$str" : '.*,\(.*\)!')  
     echo "Result: $result"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Result: World
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `expr` command with the `:` operator allows you to apply regular expression patterns to strings. In this example, it extracts the substring between the last comma and exclamation mark in the given string.


## 31. **Question: How do you use the `awk` command for text processing?**
   - **Answer:** The `awk` command is powerful for text processing. For example, to print the second column of a CSV file:
     ```bash
     awk -F',' '{print $2}' myfile.csv
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Yatharth
     Alice
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `awk` command with the `-F` option specifies the field separator (`,` in this case). The command then prints the second column of each line in the CSV file.

## 32. **Question: How do you use the `while` loop for continuous execution?**
   - **Answer:** The `while` loop is useful for continuous execution until a condition is met.
     ```bash
     counter=1
     while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
         echo "Iteration $counter"
         ((counter++))
     done
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Iteration 1
     Iteration 2
     Iteration 3
     Iteration 4
     Iteration 5
     ```

   **Explanation:** In this example, the `while` loop runs until the counter reaches 5. It prints the iteration number and increments the counter in each iteration.

## 33. **Question: How do you use the `shift` command in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** The `shift` command is used to shift command-line arguments.
     ```bash
     while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
         echo "Argument: $1"
         shift
     done
     ```
     **Command:**
     ```bash
     ./myscript.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Argument: arg1
     Argument: arg2
     Argument: arg3
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `shift` command moves the command-line arguments to the left. In this example, it iterates through the arguments and prints each one.

## 34. **Question: How do you use the `sleep` command in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** The `sleep` command is used to introduce delays in a script.
     ```bash
     echo "Waiting for 3 seconds..."
     sleep 3
     echo "Done!"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Waiting for 3 seconds...
     Done!
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `sleep` command pauses the script execution for the specified number of seconds. In this example, it waits for 3 seconds before printing "Done!".

## 35. **Question: How do you use the `tee` command in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** The `tee` command is used to redirect output to a file and the terminal simultaneously.
     ```bash
     echo "This is some text." | tee output.txt
     ```
     **Check the contents of the file:**
     ```bash
     cat output.txt
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     This is some text.
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `tee` command takes input and writes it to both the specified file (`output.txt`) and the terminal.

## 36. **Question: How can you check the length of a string in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `${#variable}` syntax to get the length of a string.
     ```bash
     mystring="Hello, World!"
     length=${#mystring}
     echo "Length of the string: $length"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Length of the string: 13
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `${#variable}` syntax is used to get the length of the string stored in the variable `mystring`.

## 37. **Question: How do you use the `read` command with a timeout in a shell script?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `-t` option with the `read` command to set a timeout.
     ```bash
     echo "Press any key within 5 seconds..."
     if read -t 5; then
         echo "Key pressed!"
     else
         echo "Timed out."
     fi
     ```
     **Output (if key pressed within 5 seconds):**
     ```
     Press any key within 5 seconds...
     Key pressed!
     ```
     **Output (if no key pressed within 5 seconds):**
     ```
     Press any key within 5 seconds...
     Timed out.
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `-t` option sets a timeout for the `read` command. If a key is pressed within the specified time, it continues with "Key pressed!"; otherwise, it times out.

## 38. **Question: How do you use the `tr` command for character translation?**
   - **Answer:** The `tr` command is used for character translation or deletion.
     ```bash
     echo "Hello, World!" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Uryyb, Jbeyq!
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `tr` command here translates each letter in the input string by 13 positions, implementing a simple Caesar cipher.

## 39. **Question: How do you use the `basename` and `dirname` commands?**
   - **Answer:** The `basename` command extracts the filename, and `dirname` extracts the directory name from a path.
     ```bash
     filepath="/path/to/myfile.txt"
     echo "Filename: $(basename $filepath)"
     echo "Directory: $(dirname $filepath)"
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Filename: myfile.txt
     Directory: /path/to
     ```

   **Explanation:** The `basename` command extracts the filename, and `dirname` extracts the directory name from the specified filepath.

## 40. **Question: How do you use the `printf` command for formatted output?**
   - **Answer:** The `printf` command allows you to format and print text.
     ```bash
     name="Alice"
     age=25
     printf "Name: %s\nAge: %d\n" "$name" $age
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     Name: Alice
     Age: 25
     ```
